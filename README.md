# Object Grouper

**Object Grouper** is a comprehensive Unity Editor tool for organizing your scene hierarchy. It provides many more options than a simple "Create Empty" parent, including automated naming, selective grouping based on filters, and flattening existing hierarchies.

## Features

-   **Dynamic Grouping**: Group selected objects under a new parent with a custom name.
-   **Smart Parenting**: Automatically set the pivot of the group parent to the center of child objects.
-   **Filtering**: Group only objects that match specific criteria (tag, layer, name pattern).
-   **Cleanup**: One-click cleanup to remove empty groups or redundant hierarchies.
-   **Structured Logic**: Organizes your workflow using a dedicated Core/Data/UI separation.

## Usage

1.  Open **Tools > GameDevTools > Object Grouper**.
2.  Select the GameObjects you want to organize.
3.  Configure naming and pivot settings in the window.
4.  Click **Group Selected** to execute.
